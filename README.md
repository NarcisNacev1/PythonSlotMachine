## Python Slot Machine

As this was my first time messing around with Python, I decided to make a slot machine. It was a steep learning curve since Python is quite different from C++, but I got the hang of it.

### What I Learned

- **First time using Python for something like this:** 
  - **Functions:** I learned how to define and use functions in Python.
  - **Random Library:** I used the `random` library to generate random outcomes for the slots, which made the game more dynamic and realistic. Although I might have made the game a bit too difficult, as I haven't won a single time, it does add to the realism!
  - **Dictionaries:** I also learned to use dictionaries, which are very useful for storing and accessing data efficiently.
